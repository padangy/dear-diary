DearDiary is a beautiful personal app that is a platform to capture your personality in posts. Like a polaroid that you can fill with a picture, text, or both, you can fill individual postcards to showcase beautiful events, memories, and even just thoughts in your day-to-day life. Enjoy the esthetics of this personal page as well! :fireworks::star2::sparkling_heart:

## Project Description
DearDiary is a digital diary that is you can use to capture snapshots of your life and mind. Just like putting pictures and writing inside a scrapbook, this app can be used with ease and can be kept with you wherever you go.

Some challenges that came about include trying to utilize authentification so that the diary can be privatized by user but that is something to delve into further in the post-MVP. Another challenge came with using new libraries such as mongoose for the back-end and the most trouble came from using react-redux and material ui for the front-end.
